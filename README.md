# PhysLab
PhysLab is a drone specific language with 4 inbuilt types; int, double, boolean, and string. PhysLab has been designed with Swift, Java, and C++ languages in mind. It uses the flexibility of Java and simplicity of Swift1. The loop statements are similar with the loops of Swift. Moreover, the output and assignment structures are also similar. PhysLab has several built-in functions for drones only. While connect() and disconnect() functions allows drones to connect to the base station, getInclination(), getAltitude(), takePicture(), e.g. functions enables users to get data via droneâ€™s hardware.
